								This marks the date where we had quite an intense argument. 
								The fault was mine where I was being very rude and cranky toward 
								you where it was not deserved, nor will that behavior ever be 
								deserved. We ended up using the whole day being silent to each other,
								however, we did end up having an important discussion on topics like:
								"Have you ever thought of breaking up?" [Our general ans: yes, but, then 
								we realized that the hardships we have overcome makes us stronger and 
								that breaking up would be more of the "easy" way out of things. It's 
								unavaoidable, the emotions we feel with each other]. It also made me 
								realize that the more we continue to have these fights, it's completely 
								natural and a part of our relationship; proportionately, out of every 
								100 good days we have, there is bound to be around 2 bad ones that we 
								learn from and overcome, together.

          <h2>Well, what else...?</h2>
		  <p>
			After reflecting on this wonderful year that we had with each other, I realized three things:
			<li>
				How much we have grown together as a couple from the hardships we have overcame.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				That I need to take more pictures (genuinely) while still trying to be more in the present.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				No matter what challenge we face, we will always conquer it, internally and externally. 
			</li>
			<br>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<!-- Outline
			Talk about how much we are meant to be
			Talk about how much we have grown
			Talk about the reflection a bit more in-depth
			-->
			I firmly believe that in every universe, we will always find each other.
			Like all of those posts where it shows either a spoon and a fork together in the same
			drawer, or two crows holding feet, or two peas in a pod, or two lego hedgehogs on a park 
			bench under a mushroom tree we will always be together. Every moment spent together brings 
			us closer; from every moment of sunshine to every moment of gloom the time is always 
			well spent. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Rather than focusing on our growth since the beginning of our relationship, I want to 
			shine light on the growth in the past year. We have made compromises and acknowledged 
			each other's accomplishments; we have called each other's misbehavior out and the one 
			being called out genuinely listened and acknowledged their standing. I think the saying:
			"the grass is greener where you water it" is such a true statement. Relating this back to our
			conversation that we had on March 20, 2024 (The OMOMO Incident) we talked about how we 
			both did have thoughts of breaking up during our relationship. However, where are we right now?
			Still together reading this letter. We worked so hard during our relationship and "watered" 
			ourselves to make us stronger, greener. Some compromises and steps going forward we discussed 
			and decided to continue with this past year were: [1] I will communicate my feelings as soon as 
			possible (or at least say something like "hey, I'm feeling ___ and need space or time before
			we discuss it. Give me ____ time") [2] I will make more of an effort to prioritizing you
			in my schedule by being more in the present and not hyperfixating on keeping such a strict,
			time-schedule [3] We agreed to be more patient with each other and try to understand where 
			both of us come from in a given situation [4] I will communicate more effectively in situations 
			where I need time to finish something (like "hey give me ____ time to finish this."). 
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Any place and time I will always love you, no matter what. I look forward to yet another 
			amazing year with the best person to ever live on this planet; someone that strives for self-growth 
			individually and with me. We are a team continuing to improve every day we experience something 
			together and individually. I love you my girlfriend, my best friend, my soulmate, 
			my beautiful princess, my bebe cakes, my stink fart, my poop sock, my love, my Yza. 
			I haven't said this in a while, but, let's continue to experience life together.
