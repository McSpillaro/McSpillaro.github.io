# Welcome to my Freelance Portfolio!

This repository showcases my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Python (Seaborn, pandas, matplotlib, and Plotly). I have gained this experience through my pursuit in Chemical Engineering as an undergraduate. Here, you'll find a collection of projects demonstrating my ability to:

- Wrangle and clean messy data
- Uncover hidden insights and trends
- Craft compelling and informative visualizations
- Communicate findings effectively

I'm currently open to freelance data analysis projects! If you have a dataset in need of insightful visualization or simply want to discuss a potential project, don't hesitate to get in touch.
